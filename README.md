# CSVtoJSON

Quick and easy csv to json converter.

Take the file you need converted and place it inside the data folder.

In the index.js file, where the function called "convert()" is used, update the parameter with whatever file name you placed inside the data folder.

Open terminal, navigate to the root directory this project lives in and run "node index.js".

The files will be created in the output folder.
